# Day 1 - DevOps Bootcamp Notes

## Software Life Cycle

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process that software development teams follow to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. Understanding the SDLC is crucial for DevOps practices as it helps in:

- Planning and organizing development work
- Ensuring quality and reliability
- Managing resources effectively
- Delivering software in a structured manner

### Key Phases of SDLC:
1. **Planning** - Requirements gathering and project planning
2. **Design** - System architecture and design specifications
3. **Development** - Writing and coding the software
4. **Testing** - Quality assurance and testing
5. **Deployment** - Releasing software to production
6. **Maintenance** - Ongoing support and updates

## Tools to Install

### 1. Node.js
- **Purpose**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Use Case**: Running JavaScript applications, package management with npm
- **Installation**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or use package managers

### 2. Python
- **Purpose**: Programming language for automation, scripting, and development
- **Use Case**: DevOps automation, infrastructure as code, data processing
- **Installation**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use package managers

### 3. AWS CLI
- **Purpose**: Command-line interface for Amazon Web Services
- **Use Case**: Managing AWS resources, automation, infrastructure management
- **Installation**: 
  ```bash

  brew install awscli
  
  # Or download from AWS documentation
  ```

### 4. tfswitch (Terraform Switcher)
- **Purpose**: Tool to switch between different Terraform versions
- **Use Case**: Managing multiple Terraform projects with different version requirements
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch
  ```

### Additional Tools (Commonly Used)
- **Git** - Version control system
- **Docker** - Containerization platform
- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as Code
- **Ansible** - Configuration management
- **Jenkins/GitHub Actions** - CI/CD tools
